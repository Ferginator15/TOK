            picollo is not the best anime aura farmer because he is completly outranked by Sung Jinwoo. He also isn't placed at the
             top because although he aura farms like crazy when he isn't in a battle, he gets absoloutley destroyed in battle and
            is no match for current timeline enemies such as Moro and even some of the earlier enemies such as Jiren or even Hit.<br>  </p1>
